# 4 Safety requirements and/or measures

Machinery shall comply with the safety requirements and measures of Clause 4. In addition, the machine shall be designed according to the principles of EN ISO 12100:2010 for hazards relevant but not significant which are not dealt with by this standard.

4.2.1 The crane manufacturer shall select a device compatible with the intended use of the crane, taking the following into account:

a) operating environment, e.g. temperature, relative humidity, condensation, vibration;  
b) rated capacity;  
c) crane characteristics;  
d) electromagnetic compatibility.  
4.2.2 The installation of limiters and indicators shall be carried out in a manner that does not reduce the strength of the crane.  
4.2.3 The effects (e.g. forces, stopping distances) resulting from the operation of the limiter shall be within the design constraints of the crane.  
4.2.4 Systems shall enable periodic functional checks to be carried out to verify that indicators are operating correctly.  
4.2.5 If interruption of the power supply occurs, the settings of limiters and indicators shall be retained.  
4.2.6 Limiters and indicators shall be capable of withstanding the shock loads and vibrations transmitted to them during operation, erection, dismantling and maintenance of the crane.  
4.2.7 Limiters and indicators shall have legible and durable markings on or adjacent to them, preferably with symbols to indicate their function and mode of operation, and all indicators shall be compatible with ergonomic principles in accordance with EN 614-2:2000+A1:2008.  
4.2.8 Painting or other corrosion protection shall not affect the functioning of limiters and indicators.

4.2.9 Limiters forming a part of a safety related control system shall be in accordance with EN ISO 13849-1:2023. The performance levels and categories used shall be those specified by the European Standards for particular crane types.  
4.3.1 Rated capacity limiters and indicators shall be provided on all cranes having a rated capacity of  $1000\mathrm{kg}$  or above, or an overturning moment of  $40000\mathrm{Nm}$  or above due to the rated capacity (see 3.10).  
4.3.2 The rated capacity limiter and indicator shall perform in accordance with this standard for all rated capacities and all the configurations described in the information for use of the crane.  
4.3.3 If a crane can be operated with different configurations there shall be an indication of the crane configuration for which the rated capacity limiter and indicator has been set. Where a configuration selecting device is provided, a direct description of the configuration selected shall be provided on the device or a code which can be checked against a separate list of codes/configurations.  
4.3.4 The rated capacity limiter and indicator shall be designed to operate for all configurations and positions of the crane.  
4.3.5 Features shall be incorporated to minimize the risk of unintentional change of any manual setting device (e.g. by locking, double action).  
4.3.6 The number of setting positions of the configuration selection device(s) shall relate to the number of configurations provided for the crane. Positions which are not utilized shall render the crane inoperative or not cause an unsafe crane condition if selected.  
4.3.7 The design and installation of rated capacity indicators and rated capacity limiters shall allow for the possibility to test the crane with overloads without dismantling or permanently affecting the performance of the indicator or limiter. Where it is necessary to disconnect parts of the devices during testing, facilities shall be provided to check and/or reset the devices after the test.

# 4.4.1 General

4.4.1.1 The rated capacity limiter shall prevent the crane from operating outside of the designed limits.  
4.4.1.2 The rated capacity limiter designed operating force shall be determined taking into account:

a) the static force from the rated capacity;  
b) the dynamic part of the force from lifting the rated capacity;  
c) the tolerance of the force to operate the rated capacity limiter.

The tolerance for the force to operate the limiter shall be specified in the appropriate European Standard for the particular crane type. The objective shall be to ensure that the rated capacity limiter operates at as close to the rated capacity as is practicable.

# 4.4.2 Operating requirements

4.4.2.1 When the load on the crane exceeds the rated capacity, the rated capacity limiter shall override the controls of the crane to prevent any condition that increases the overload.

NOTE Reference can be made to European Standards for particular crane types for details of motions that will increase the overload.

4.4.2.2 The rated capacity limiter shall not prevent the crane operator from returning the controls to the neutral position and initiating actions that will move the crane to a reduced loading or unloaded condition.  
4.4.2.3 The rated capacity limiter, once triggered, shall continuously override the related controls until the overload has been removed and the relevant control lever has been returned to the neutral position.

# 4.5.1 Operating requirements

4.5.1.1 The rated capacity indicator shall give visual or acoustic warnings or both for all motions of the crane that induce a load in excess of the rated capacity, as shown in the information supplied by the manufacturer for the particular crane.

4.5.1.2 The rated capacity indicator shall:

a) for those cranes where the rated capacity varies according to the position of the load, warn the crane operator when the rated capacity is approached;  
b) warn crane operators and persons in the danger zone when the rated capacity limiter is triggered;  
c) for those cranes where a limiter override is provided, warn the crane operators and persons in the danger zone whenever the rated capacity limiter has been overridden.

4.5.1.3 When the rated capacity is approached, the rated capacity indicator shall give a preventative warning which gives the crane operator time to react to the warning and prevent the crane from being overloaded.

4.5.1.4 No provision shall be made for the crane operator to switch off a warning from the control station, except when both acoustic and visual warnings are used for the same situation, in which case the acoustic warning may have a manual reset that becomes operable after the warning has been active for 5 s. If such a manual reset is used, the warning shall automatically operate if the crane subsequently returns to a condition requiring an acoustic warning. Provision may be made to switch off the acoustic warning during calibration and testing of the crane.

# 4.5.2 Form of warning

4.5.2.1 Warnings for both the approach to rated capacity, in cases where it is required, and for rated capacity being exceeded shall be continuous, see 3.2. There shall be a clear difference between the warning for approach and the warning for overload, e.g. a visual warning may be one colour for the approach and another colour for overload.  
4.5.2.2 Warnings shall be in accordance with EN 61310-1:2008 and Clause 10 of EN 60204-32:2008.  
4.5.2.3 Visual warnings for the crane operator shall be positioned to be in full view from every control station without obscuring the crane operator's view of the load and its immediate surroundings.

# 4.6.1 Motion limiters

4.6.1.1 Any motion which has a designed restriction of movement shall be provided with motion limiters.

NOTE 1 Reference can be made to European Standards for particular crane types for further information.  
NOTE 2 Examples are listed as follows: hoisting limiter, lowering limiter, slack rope limiter, slewing limiter, travelling and traversing limiter, derricking limiter, telescoping limiter, control station position limiter, working space limiter, anti-collision device.  
4.6.1.2 The effect of one motion upon another shall be taken into account in the design, where that motion can cause another limit to be exceeded.  
4.6.1.3 Where a motion is provided with one motion limiter, after the triggering of that motion limiter, movement in the opposite direction of the motion to a safe condition shall be possible without resetting.

NOTE Movement in the same direction is possible without resetting if the triggering condition is removed.

4.6.1.4 Where a second limiter is provided for a motion, failure of the first limiter shall result in an indication of the failure to the crane operator by means as specified in the appropriate European Standard for the particular crane type. To ensure continued safety of the crane, it shall not be possible to operate the limited motion in both directions after the second limiter has been triggered until a reset action has been carried out. This reset action shall not be available to the crane operator at the active control station. The indication and reset action are not required when the second limiter is a fixed stop designed to absorb the energy of the motion.  
4.6.1.5 If two or more motions can be carried out simultaneously, the design of the motion limiters shall take into account the effects of the possible combinations.

# 4.6.2 Performance limiters

4.6.2.1 A motion shall have a performance limiter if:

a) the motion has a designed performance limitation;  
b) there is an external force which could cause the performance limitation to be exceeded (e.g. gravity).

NOTE Examples of aspects of crane performance that can be required to be limited are speed, acceleration, deceleration.

4.6.2.2 A performance limiter is not required where the design inherently prevents performance limits from being exceeded.  
4.6.2.3 If two or more motions can be carried out simultaneously, the design of the performance limiter shall take into account the effects of these combinations.

4.7.1 Indicators shall be fitted to cranes in accordance with the requirements given in the European Standards for the specific crane types.  
4.7.2 Continuous unambiguous visual, acoustic, or tactile indication shall be provided for the crane operator when required.  
4.7.3 Indicators shall be in accordance with EN 61310-1:2008 and Clause 10 of EN 60204-32:2008.  
4.7.4 The response time of indicators shall be appropriate to the rate of change of the indicated value.

# 5 Verification of the safety requirements and/or measures

5.1 Verification of limiting and indicating devices shall be generally carried out when installed on a crane. However, when applicable, individual components may be separately verified or tested (e.g. marking). Conformity to safety requirements and/or measures (given in Annex A, Table A.1) shall be verified by the methods detailed in Table 1.
